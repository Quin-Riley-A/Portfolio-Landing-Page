          <p class="card-text">
          Hello, my name is Quin, thank you for your interest in my work so far. To start off with a little bit about me, I am a 25 year old Epicodus student currently living and working in northern New England. I have a passion for writing and attempting to understand the <span class=italic>nuances</span> of new ideas both collaboratively and in my own work.</p> 
          <p>I really enjoy reading and discussion as a way to absorb the meaning of people's varied ideas and trying to incorporate a comprehension of the things I've learned into how I interlocute and further my understanding of other people.</p>
          <p>I am currently a learning programmer and student at Epicodus. The course has so far proved to be an excellent method for improving my technical skills that I had not previously encountered. In the <strong>near future,</strong> I am seeking a career in the field of <strong>software-development.</strong></p>

          <h5 class="card-title">Why Epicodus</h5>
          <p class="card-text">
            Initially, I heard of Epicodus via a friend of my <span class="cute">partner</span> living in Oregon. They had an excellent experience over the span of the course in which their knowledge and comfort with coding had improved a great deal. While I was interested in the prospects of the class from the beginning, I was enthused to learn the course offered the potential for a scholarship to underrepresented groups within the industry.</p>
            <p>As a transgender woman with an education background in Computer Science and an interest in coding, the chance to undertake this class seemed too good an opportunity to pass-by. After discussion with the advisory staff of Epicodus, I was encouraged to apply for the scholarship program. To my amazement, was accepted for the course! I look forward to what this course has to offer in the future, and what I can contribute.

          <h5 class="card-title">Hobbies,Interests</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Outside of my time devoted to the work of computer hardware and further learning in the field of computer science, I find time to hike and enjoy the great outdoors.</p>
          <p class="card-text">I also enjoy reading books! My favorite genres are speculative-fiction/fantansy and historical essays/politcal analysis. Here are some works I've recently read that I really enjoyed:
